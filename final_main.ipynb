I wish so much I didn't have to care, but my entire life money was the root of so many problems. now it's just the never ending circle around the drain of perseverance. I really don't know why I keep going. all my friends say they love me, but they have better, richer lives without me. I wish so much I had the courage to even change. instead I'm just stuck in this claustrophobia nightmare. panic inducing rage and sadness from only ever wanting my mom to fucking smile. I never wanted anything for myself, never needed anything for myself. now I don't even know how to dream for myself if I wanted because it's all just one giant rug pull in the end. one lonely dark road that no amount of money can make brighter. but God damnit can I just have enough to breathe for a day, do I have to be this wheel spinning forever. it makes me dizzy. when does it stop. is this why we fight wars to let it all out? is this why we try to create something else to distract ourselves.

You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.\\n\\n**If I had a dollar for every time someone built these jokes:** Consider it as a market recap.

I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\\n\\n**Can I use the code/is it open source:** Yes.\\n\\n**What is sentiment:** It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.\\n\\n**If I had a dollar for every time someone built these jokes:** Consider it as a market recap. Plus more the number of programs, the more you know someone is not bullshitting you with the list as you can just as easily cross-verify.\\n\\nCheers!\")\n",
